### Do you have more then 10 open tabs? than this plugin is for you.  
Navigate To is a new and efficient way to quickly navigate between tabs(files) in your Notepad++. It allows you to search for a symbol or filename, filepath by matching against a keyword you type in, and get a real time preview while going through the search results by Shift key.  
And YES indeed you can uncheck the Multi-line option, in the Preferences > General > Tab Bar zone because you don’t need the multi-lines tab feature anymore :)
